# DictionaryBot

This is a little bot that provides the definitions of words.

## Usage

Just write a message as `def <word>` where `<word>` is replaced by the word you
want to define. For example:

```
def hello
```

Bot says this in response:

> ### hello
> #### Noun
> an expression of greeting
